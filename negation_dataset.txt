1 it showcases carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .
1 the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
3 so unassuming and pure of heart , you ca n't help but warmly extend your arms and yell ` safe ! '
3 kinnear does n't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth .
3 this is a story of two misfits who do n't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent .
3 but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned can not be said to suck .
3 the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances .
3 inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat .
3 highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved cool as ice have at last found a worthy follow-up .
3 it 's one heck of a character study -- not of hearst or davies but of the unique relationship between them .
3 it 's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker 's movie adaptation .

3 all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us .
4 not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it 's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time .
4 not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j.k. rowling 's books .
4 montias ... pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters .
4 nine queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head .

0 a lousy movie that 's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable .
0 bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
1 ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but do n't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here .
1 as a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it does n't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions .
1 the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured -lrb- and torturing -rrb- artists and consuming but impossible love that you ca n't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .
1 stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd .

1 but i was n't .
1 if you 're not a prepubescent girl , you 'll be laughing at britney spears ' movie-starring debut whenever it does n't have you impatiently squinting at your watch .
1 accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart , then you need to use more poetic license .
1 but that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients .

1 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just does n't make the cut .
1 birot 's directorial debut -lrb- she co-wrote the script with christophe honor√© -rrb- is n't so much bad as it is bland .
1 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman -lrb- who never gets to play that flute -rrb- has all the charm of a meltdown .
1 there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
1 not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i 've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school `` cartoon '' .
1 frenetic but not really funny .

3 who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images do n't have to add up to mesmerize you .
3 is n't quite the equal of woo 's best earlier work , but it 's easily his finest american film ... comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films .
3 the film 's real appeal wo n't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers .
3 do n't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life .
